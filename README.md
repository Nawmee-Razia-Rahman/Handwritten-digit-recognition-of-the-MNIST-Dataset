# Handwritten-digit-recognition-of-the-MNIST-Dataset
This is my third-year project. My project was to apply some supervised learning algorithms to recognize handwritten digits and calculate their error rate. For this purpose, I implemented a paper.

The work is done based on four algorithms:
i)Support Vector Machine
ii)K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
iii)Logistic Regression
iv)Convolutional Neural Network

The main work of the paper, that is implemented on the project is to find validation and test dataset error along with CPU calculation time. Confusion matrix was used to visualize the performance of the classifier by displaying expected values vs predicted values in a matrix for the test dataset.
The paper is attached to the folder.
